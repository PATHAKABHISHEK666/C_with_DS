🧮 1. Temperature Conversion (Call by Reference)

Write a C program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin using a call-by-reference function named convertTemp().
Accept temperature in Celsius as input.
Use pointers to return both Fahrenheit and Kelvin values.
Display the results with two decimal precision.



📏 2. Rectangle Perimeter and Area (Dual Pointer)

Write a C program that accepts the length and width of a rectangle in meters.
Use a function calculateRectangle() that takes two pointers as input and returns area and perimeter via two separate pointer parameters.
Display both the area and perimeter formatted to two decimal places.



💧 3. Volume and Surface Area of a Cylinder

Write a program to find the volume and surface area of a cylinder using a call-by-reference function cylinderMetrics().
Take radius and height as input.
Use dual pointers to store and return the volume and surface area.
Display the results neatly.



⚡ 4. Electricity Bill Calculation

Create a C program to compute an electricity bill using a call-by-reference function billCalculator().
Take the number of units consumed as input.
Apply a rate of ₹2.50 per unit for the first 100 units and ₹3.50 thereafter.
Return the total bill using a pointer.
Display an error message for invalid input.



💲 5. Simple Interest and Amount (Dual Pointer)

Write a C program that calculates simple interest and total amount using the formula:

SI = 𝑃×𝑅×𝑇/100
Function: interestCalculator()
Inputs: principal, rate, time
Outputs via pointers: simple interest and total amount (P + SI)



🌡️ 6. Swap Two Numbers (Using Dual Pointers)

Write a function swapValues() that uses two pointers to swap the values of two integers entered by the user.
Demonstrate the swap operation using both input and output prints.

⏱️ 7. Time Conversion (Minutes → Hours & Minutes)
Write a C program to convert total minutes into hours and remaining minutes using a call-by-reference function timeConverter().
Input: total minutes
Output (via pointers): hours and minutes
Example: 130 minutes → 2 hours and 10 minutes



🧱 8. Paint Job Cost (Dual Pointer Enhanced)
Modify your original painter program so that the function feesCalculator() returns both the area and total fees using dual pointers instead of one.
One pointer for area, another for total fees.
Handle invalid inputs with a message.



⚙️ 9. Circle Metrics (Dual Pointer)

Write a program that reads the radius of a circle and uses a dual pointer function circleMetrics() to compute and return the area and circumference.
Use π = 3.1416.
Display results with appropriate units.

💻 10. Student Marks Analyzer (Call by Reference)
Write a C program that takes marks of 3 subjects and uses a function analyzeMarks() with dual pointers to return:
The total marks
The average marks
Display both values formatted to two decimal places.
