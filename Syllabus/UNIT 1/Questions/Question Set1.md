# C Programming Practice Questions

## 1. Structure of a C Program
- Write a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" and explain its structure.
- Modify the program to include comments explaining each section (header files, main function, statements).

## 2. Data Types in C
- Declare variables of all basic data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, `long`) and print their sizes using `sizeof()`.
- Write a program that takes an integer and a float as input and prints their sum.

## 3. Identifiers and Keywords
- Identify valid and invalid identifiers in the following list: `int1`, `1int`, `_value`, `float`, `MyVariable`.
- Write a program using at least 5 C keywords correctly.

## 4. Operators & Expressions
- Write a program to calculate `(a + b) * (c - d)` using operators.
- Demonstrate the difference between `++i` and `i++` in a program.

## 5. Preprocessor Directives
- Write a program using `#define` to define a constant `PI` and calculate the area of a circle.
- Create a program that includes a header file and uses a function from it.

## 6. Input and Output in C
- Write a program that takes two integers as input using `scanf` and prints their product.
- Write a program that writes a string to a file and then reads it back.

## 7. Type Casting in C
- Write a program that divides two integers and prints both the integer result and the floating-point result using type casting.

## 8. Operator Precedence & Associativity
- Predict the output of the following expression: `int x = 10 + 20 * 30;`
- Write a program to demonstrate the difference between `a + b * c` and `(a + b) * c`.

## 9. Scope of Variables
- Write a program to demonstrate the use of global and local variables with the same name.
- Write a program that shows block-level scope using `{}`.

## 10. Control Constructs
- Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else`.
- Write a program that uses `switch` to display the day of the week for a given number (1–7).

## 11. Iteration Constructs
- Write a program to print the first 10 natural numbers using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops separately.
- Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.

## 12. Functions – Defining and Accessing
- Write a function to add two numbers and call it from `main()`.
- Write a function that returns the maximum of two numbers.

## 13. Passing Arguments (Call by Value / Call by Reference)
- Write a program to demonstrate call by value (try swapping two numbers).
- Write a program to demonstrate call by reference (successfully swap two numbers).

## 14. Function Prototypes & Declaration
- Write a program with a function prototype declared before `main()` and its definition after `main()`.

## 15. Recursion
- Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- Write a recursive function to print Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.

## 16. Storage Classes
- Write a program demonstrating the use of `auto` variables.
- Write a program to show how `static` variables retain their value across function calls.
- Write a program using `extern` variables across multiple files (conceptual).
- Write a program demonstrating the use of `register` variables.
