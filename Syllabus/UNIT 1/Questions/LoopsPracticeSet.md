## 📌 Section 5: Prime Numbers

### Problem 8

**Task:** Write a program to check if a given number is **prime**.

* Input: A number `n`.
* Output: “Prime” or “Not Prime”.
* Hint: A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself.

---

## 📌 Section 6: Break and Continue

### Problem 9

**Task:** Print all odd numbers from 1 to 100 using the `continue` statement.

* Hint: Skip even numbers using `continue`.

---

### Homework 5

**Task:** Print all even numbers from 1 to 100 using the `continue` statement.

---

## 📌 Section 7: Loops

* Understand the concept of `while` loops.
* Write a program that demonstrates an **infinite loop**.
* Try breaking out of an infinite loop using `break`.

---

## 📌 Section 8: Predict the Output

### Problems 10–18

A series of code snippets will be given. You must **predict the output without running the code**.

### Homework 6

Predict the output of given code (10).

---

## 📌 Section 9: Operators

* Learn the difference between **pre-increment (`++i`)** and **post-increment (`i++`)**.
* Solve small problems using arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.

---

## 📌 Section 10: Number-Based Programs

### Problem 19

**Task:** Count the number of digits in a given number.

---

### Problem 20

**Task:** Print the sum of digits of a given number.

---

### Homework 7

**Task:** Print the sum of **even digits** of a given number.

---

### Problem 21

**Task:** Print the reverse of a given number.

---

### Homework 8

**Task:** Print the sum of a number and its reverse.

---

### Problem 22

**Task:** Print the sum of the series:

```
1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 … up to n terms
```

---

### Problem 23

**Task:** Print the factorial of a given number.

---

### Homework 9

**Task:** Print the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

---

## 📌 Section 12: Power and ASCII

### Problem 26

**Task:** Given two numbers `a` and `b`, compute `a^b` (a raised to the power b).

---

### Problem 27

**Task:** Print all alphabets with their corresponding ASCII values.

* Example Output:

  ```
  A → 65
  B → 66
  ...
  Z → 90

✨ This workbook can be used for **self-study, coding practice, or assignments**. Each problem builds upon the previous, ensuring a strong foundation in loops, conditionals, and number-based logic.

Would you like me to also **add sample solutions (in Python or C++)** after each section so it becomes a **full guidebook** instead of just a problem sheet?
